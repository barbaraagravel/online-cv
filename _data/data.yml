career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      PhD candidate in Bioinformatics investigating how to use computational approaches to identify pathogenic oligogenic variant combinations in exome 
      sequencing data. The main goals of my projects are to create a database of disease-causing oligogenic combinations reported in the literature,
      use this data to train a machine learning tool that is effectively able to prioritize variant combinations in exome sequencing data and then 
      use this tool to identify 
      potentially meaningful oligogenic signatures in epilepsy patients cohorts.
